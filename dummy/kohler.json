Was told that an order was placed for a new stream breaker and valve to ensure the issue is resolved. I received the parts about 10 days later, however the directions provided were for a completely different faucet. I had to search the web for the instructions on how to replace the valve. I finally found one. The list of tools needed in the instructions provided were competely wrong and I learned that I had to purchase a 3/4 inch socket wrench to change the valve. I was finally able to complete the task from researching Youtube videos, and now have a constant drip from the faucet.\r\r\nI also received a new stream breaker along with instructions that basically said remove the screw and pop out the old stream breaker and replace it with the new. I removed the screw but I have not been able to remove the existing stream breaker. Once again the instructions provided were useless and I had to research the web for help. I have tried and tried and it will not come out and now the water sprays all over.\r\r\nThe email from the Kohler representative included a phone number to call for additional assistance. I have tried repeatedly to call the number provided and each time I get the same recording that says due to high call volume they can't take my call and then I get disconnected. The recording also suggests I watch the videos on Kohler's website except there is no video for this faucet. Kohler's support is awful and the faucet is worse. I am forced to purchase a new faucet.

I was going to just buy another toilet seat as it's not exactly the most expensive thing in the world, but when I was looking at their products online I saw that they have videos that specifically say that their toilet seats aren't supposed to be able to move around due to their construction (which is the reason ours snapped - because it was moving around). I decided to give them a call and see if there was anything that they would do about it figuring they would just send us new clips.\r\r\nThe woman I was on the phone with was easy to work with, easy to understand, quick to take down my information, and prompt in her response. After explaining I didn't have proof of purchase (I bought the toilet in store and stupidly threw out the receipt) and that I had only had it for about a year and what had happened she asked me to e-mail them a picture of the part that was broken while on the phone with them. I did, they received it quickly, and they sent me out a new toilet seat no further questions asked! Plus, they made me an account so next time I just have to give them my phone number to receive help.\r\r\nIf this is how all of their customer service goes I will be super impressed. My parents also own Kohler products and have expressed the same satisfaction with their customer service experiences. What a great company. I didn't even have to ask for a manager, which unfortunately seems to be the standard these days to get any kind of response!",

My concern was with the difficulty in changing out the braided line (which had developed a leak) for our pull out kitchen faucet. I did work for some time and know others had stated their frustration. I struggled with removing the collet end from the connector. What I discovered is that you do not have to move the tabs as far as I thought. Because the hose had been connected for 4 years there was some scale built up. I simply needed to exert a bit more downward pressure on the hose as I pushed up on the tabs. It came loose. Inexperience was responsible for some of my frustration.",

        "desc": "Had a Kohler toilet installed when my bathroom was renovate several years ago. The low boy toilet requires a compression anchor to be installed in the base of toilet to the seat can be fastened. After many years of good use, the seat spontaneously cracked, and cracked a second time. I ordered a replacement and to my horror I learned of the unusual anchoring method. The anchor mechanism consists of a compression threaded bolt inserted in the porcelain body of the toilet and then a threaded machine screw is place through a tab on the seat and then into the anchor. The screw is frozen into the base of toilet and the screw will not mover after treating with likes of liquid wrench and configuring a screw drive blade into a socket wrench for more torque.\r\r\nThe customer service rep insisted I need the Kohler removal tool to stabilize the anchor so it would allow me to turn the screw. After several attempts at explaining the problem, I gave up!!! Send photos and essentially these comments to an email address provided by the agent for photos. I do not know if anyone received the email because as yet I have not gotten a reply. Truth be said, as if have read in many posts, the service after purchase does not hold up to the reputation of Kohler. All I wanted was to remove the screws from the anchor in the Kohler Toilet.",

It must have to do with the manufacturing process - probably cheaper to make!\r\r\nNot only will there be the cost of getting a new sink, but the labor cost of having this one taken out and a new one put in! Do all of their sinks rust? No sink should have a problem with water & soap! I would expect a new sink and covering the cost of replacing it. I asked the company if they could provide the cleaning agent, but they said they could not. My plumber said that he would not buy any more of their sinks and I certainly will not either.",

        "desc": "We looked at Kohler designs and what exactly was a handicapped-accessible shower. I needed something to sit down because it's terrifying. Sometimes, youï¿½d almost lose your balance and fall. Iï¿½ve had multiple surgeries, so I canï¿½t afford that. Itï¿½s not really Kohler per se, but a father or parent company. My folks who live in a nice subdivision here, and my sister and brother-in-law, they live in a very nice area. No one goes in for cheap designs. Right now, I'm able to get this shower underway with some financial support and Iï¿½m very blessed to be experiencing it.\r\r\nBefore we went with them we were with a different manufacturer. Their permit was invalid. It was fraudulent at best. They werenï¿½t licensed to be putting in this type of product in my home. The village inspector came and called me to give me heads up. They lied and lied and lied about the start date and start time, too. We were very upset and disappointed. When we finally got our money back, I said, ï¿½We should see what Kohler has to say.ï¿½ I saw this ad and theyï¿½re really top one. Theyï¿½re very expensive but as it turns out, they were very reasonably priced. It was quite nice and beautiful.\r\r\nItï¿½s not really a tub. Itï¿½s a handicapped-accessible shower. I love the showerhead and the actual look of the marbled type of design on the floor. I also love the brushed nickel and the surrounding walls. However, I do have a quirk about the shower enclosure for the handicapped-accessibility. The caulking along the sides of the three-sided wall is not the right type of component or compound, according to my fiancï¿½. He was from ServiceMaster and has been in this business for a long time. It doesnï¿½t hold any painterï¿½s tape if you wanted to cut in for painting and trim 'cause it's all decorated real nice on the exterior part.\r\r\nAlso, as much as I tried, the seat itself is quite slippery. When you go to sit down, you literally slide ride off it. Itï¿½s not that I have it soapy, but itï¿½s either on an angle and my legs are not that long to actually hit the floor. I would have preferred a different type of seat than what I have. I did not expect to have this type of seat. I just thought it would be a little bumped out acrylic kind of material. There are also no hooks to put like a little soap brush.\r\r\nI just wish to goodness that I sat and talked with the designer or the salesman. I would have had something a little different in mine than what I have right now, even though there are no doors on there. Itï¿½s not quite finished being painted. It shouldn't have to be, but itï¿½s for the ceiling fan and all the hardware to get put in. I would have had the closet just altered and somewhat of the walls not through all the way to extend my vanity. Itï¿½s collapsing and eroding. Itï¿½s on an angle, itï¿½s chipped and itï¿½s 33 years old. Itï¿½s very ugly, way outdated and rusty. I donï¿½t like it at all.\r\r\nYou also have to really get down there and clean out the openings of the drain. Thereï¿½s body hair always and Iï¿½m not a hairy woman. It doesnï¿½t slide down very well at all. I may also end up going to get some brushed nickels to really fix everything up real pretty. But overall, we love Kohler. There's none better. Everyone was exquisitely professional, very courteous and clean. They are right on target and I was very pleased with that.",

The rep again offered to replace the faucet, and offered a different model (as the original model was again on backorder).\r\r\nWhile the original functionality issues are a bummer, I'm grateful with Kohler's commitment to their customer and standing behind their products. I have had so many bad experiences that turned worse with bad customer service teams, but this is a bad product experience turned better with a good customer service team. I'll definitely be sticking with Kohler for future fixture purchases.",

When the tub was delivered the delivery man mentioned to look for any flaws because the Kohler warehouse had a recent fire and they did their best to check the merchandise to make sure there was no damage before they released it. The tub looked fine at first and we installed tub, floor tile and surrounding shower tile. A few months later there were cracks in the porcelain in all four corners. We contacted the retail location where we purchased the tub and Kohler right away. The thought of having to remove tiles and replace the tub was daunting so we wanted to explore the cheaper route by having the tub resurfaced.\r\r\nKohler sent an agent to the house and recommended that we do NOT resurface the tub because he did not trust what was going on with the tub underneath and could not guarantee the quality on the work to last. We were advised to submit a claim for replacement and to get an estimate for the other materials we had to destroy and replace by having to put in a replacement tub. The agent took pictures of the damage and to show we were a loyal customer pictures of all the other Kohler products; purist faucets for one that cost much more than the tub. We had to do a lot of chasing after the initial agent came to our home.\r\r\nThe Kohler rep that was in charge of the claim and service took forever to get back to us. We gave her everything she asked for. There were several emails with extended periods of time before she would respond to us. She was not even responding timely the retail location where we purchased the tub. Our estimate for labor and to replace materials was not high but the agent refused to pay the full cost of the repairs. To date I have received no compensation from them. She was stating the warranty did not allow it but they knowingly sold a product they knew was possibly flawed due to a fire. The tub was less than a yr old!\r\r\nAlso keep in mind again we tried to go the more inexpensive ways to fix the tub and their agent said that would not be in our best interest. She could care less that we were told about the fire and possible damage and said the fire did not cause damage. So the fire wasn't the cause then the only alternative is a poor quality product. A brand new tub less than a year old should not have cracked. I had an old pink tub porcelain tub from the sixties in my bathroom that was flawless but who wants a pink tub. This remodel took forever and it is very stressful to have to replace the tub and surrounding materials. I will never buy another Kohler product. I have two other bathrooms to remodel that will not have Kohler.",

The Sunstruck bathtub was never delivered from the factory to our supplier until we called for delivery for installation (over 2 months had passed) and Kohler still hadnï¿½t shipped it, when contacted they said ï¿½oh we didnï¿½t have the drain assembly in stock so we didnï¿½t ship itï¿½. When I unpacked the tub to measure for installation requirements (they do NOT provide a footprint for any particular tub in their installation sheets so you have to physically have the tub present to know that important bit of information) I found that the drain on the bath portion of the tub had a huge amount of acrylic material on the underside of the bath portion and it would impede attachment of the drain assembly.\r\r\nI immediately contacted my supplier and then called Kohler customer support. Was asked to send photographs of drain problem, which I did. I was willing to grind it off but thought better of that idea since if I screwed it up there would be no recourse for me. So had to have another tub shipped and the old one picked up for return. The customer service rep said the tub should never have passed inspection and it should have been corrected prior to shipping the tub to anyone. Quality control is dead at Kohler.\r\r\nNow onto my latest problem with Kohler... We ordered a Kohler chair height toilet and in the process of me installing it (usually about a 20 minute job) I ran into a problem with a leak between the bowl and tank. I attempted to readjust and retighten the bolts, align the gasket, but nothing worked... This toilet was pouring water out the tank bottom all over the floor. I used at least 6 full size towels and they were soaked. I called Kohler CS again and explained the problem. She said the only thing they could do is send another assembly for the tank, a metal bracket and gasket. And of course it would take several days to ship due to the holidays and all... Well, here I sit with a toilet that canï¿½t be used, and Kohler not too worried about my problem.\r\r\nI found a two solutions to my problem... First, I removed all the toilet guts from the tank and reinstalled them. As I removed the standpipe and gasket from the bottom of the tank I found that the gasket had been installed by the factory improperly and could not seal as installed. Once I fixed this problem and reassembled the toilet, attached the tank for the 5th time, there were no leaks. Another quality control, or lack thereof, issue. I tell you this is the last Kohler product I purchase. I wasted an entire day on an issue that was created at the factory. Such poor craftsmanship and poor quality issues upon assembly this company needs a legal wake up call. So long Kohler... Hello any other manufacturer.",

Don't buy Kohler.",

When someone from Kohler came to look at it, we were told the we purchased it and we should have done more research. When reliable company, like Kohler, list the shower base say it is no slip, it should be no slip. They told us we can apply a nonslip coating to the shower base, but that would void the warranty. This is the last time we will buy a Kohler Product.",

Well that is not true, we had to pay an additional $1600 for plumbing in order to connect to the tub. I also just found out we need an 80-90 gallon water heater and I only have a 40 gallon heater. My mom only gets enough hot water to cover her legs, but not enough to use the jets. I am so disappointed that a respected company such as Kohler does not honor what they promise. The company that installed the tub had no idea that a larger water heater was needed? So the most expensive walk-in tub on the market is now costing me an additional cost of between $2200-$3200 thousand dollars. I have called complained and nothing. Buyer beware!",

The only minor problem is that the button which switches the water flow from \"running\" to \"spray\" has worn thin and torn, so this needs to be revised to withstand more wear & tear.

Some of the building contractors that we work for use Kohler products such as toilets, kitchen, faucets. Shower systems being a warranty service tech we are required to deal with manufacturer warranty for one year of ownership. So lately I have been having nothing but issues with Kohler toilet tanks pull-down faucets and their shower hits. Let's start with the toilet tanks with the dual flush handle. That is the biggest piece of junk out there. It's almost like you got to have an engineering degree the fix the duel flushing handle system to their kitchen spray hoses.\r\r\nI've been changing out a ton of those because they are bursting near the head on the hose when you go to unattach the hose from valve body. It is extremely difficult to do a five-minute job on that. Has been taken us 25 minutes just to try to get that hose disconnected from underneath the sink. The third most common issues are the shower heads that are about 4 in route over time. They are leaking past the ball joint on the back of the head and ruining sheetrock so as a service tech I call Kohler to get lifetime replacement parts. Every time I call her they are nothing but a pain in the ** to deal with. They don't want to replace their products without an argument. They treat you like you don't know what you're doing.\r\r\nA products that were so simple in the beginning for Kohler at becomes so difficult to even work on and very expensive for homeowners out of warranty. Anybody reading this I would have second thoughts before you purchase any Kohler products. Moen, Delta, Pfister, American Standard, other plumbing manufacturers their products are easy to work on and if you need a replacement part they don't give you half the ** that Kohler does for being in the trade for 33 years. I would absolutely not put one freaking Kohler product in my house even if they gave it to me for free. I would never install it in my home.",

Today while I was shaving, I heard a loud thud and the cracks opened up and the water ran into the cabinet below. I emailed Kohler about a month ago and told them the problem I was having and they told me it was only warranted for one year. About 15 years ago I paid more than $1000.00 for this sink, and would like to know if there is any class action lawsuits against this company.",

        "desc": "We were getting ready to have our bathroom(s) remodeled. I had a plumber come in and we redid all the plumbing in the home as well as took care of the outside lines. My husband is chronically ill with a lot of illnesses and we thought it would be best to take care of all of this while we could in case he would die and I would not have to do this task as a widow for resale purposes. We bought this toilet for a few reasons. It was a Kohler (Santa Rosa Toilet) and my husband liked in the showroom. It was the most expensive toilet we ever had and in reality it should have outlasted us for the rest of our lifetime. The toilet was bought (July 2015) for the complete remodel of our upstairs bathroom, March/April 2016. This one piece toilet fit perfect in our bathroom.\r\r\nApproximately 4-5 weeks ago the toilet began to not flush with no power behind the water to push the waste thru the lines. At one point I had a big bowl that I would fill with water to be able to flush the toilet. I had a plumber come in charge me $160 to tell me there was nothing wrong with the lines or toilet. I myself went on my roof to check out the breathing pipe thinking there was something there hindering this. I took a bucket of water up with me and pushed the water through and all was well. I continued to seek what the problem was. I had the toilet pulled and re-set - there was nothing. I emailed Kohler and they were gracious enough to send me the inside parts to see if that would fix the problem. I just recently received the parts and had a plumber come and trade out the parts of the toilet and it went from partially flushing to not flushing at all.\r\r\nI emailed Kohler and they tried calling back. I called them today and they immediately jumped to the conclusion and guaranteed me it was NOT the toilet and that I have an obstruction in my lines. Really...a guarantee without even looking at this - nothing. The guy, who determines and makes exceptions for Kohler to decide which customers receives help and who does not, was so sure of himself as a NON certified plumber that the issue was not the product that it was my lines. It would be interesting to have someone from Kohler to come get their expensive 500 dollar toilet and prove to me that it is not their product that is not the issue. Who says that it could not be. I immediately needed to run out to get another toilet as this is our MAIN bathroom. I bought a one piece GLACIER BAY from Home Depot as this is the same toilet that I have in the downstairs basement right below the main toilet.\r\r\nBy the way (they are directly aligned) and it works perfectly! The plumber came again and installed it and it works beautifully...just like my expensive Kohler used to. SO if in fact the problem lies within the internal/external lines why does this toilet that was just installed work well? Kohler was of no help, they did not stand by the product. All I kept hearing is that I was out of the warranty timeframe and there was nothing they could do. So $510 dollars more later they can do nothing. Kohler should be ashamed on how they handled this situation...regardless of warranty or no warranty, this is THEIR PRODUCT issue that should have had more time devoted to dealing with this issue here. I could care less if I buy another Kohler product...which by the way both of my bathrooms are all Kohler except for the toilets.",

As far as Gallagher's handling the water damage and install cost, we have sent them bids, pictures and over twenty five emails and numerous phone calls. We have received nothing, just the run around.

        "desc": "I have several plumbing fixtures from Kohler: kitchen sink faucet, bath and shower fixtures. When the kitchen faucet was about 8 years old it started leaking water from just below the handle. I phoned Kohler customer service. They were very helpful and sent out a part which I replaced myself, and the faucet has functioned perfectly ever since. Bath faucet also had a problem at about age 8-9 years; same story. Customer service was great, sent me a part (free of charge), and all is well. Right now we are having a problem with the shower faucet. After googling and not finding a way to fix it, I phoned Kohler today (6/13/17, 2 pm) and spoke with Jennifer. She was - like all the other representatives I've spoken with at Kohler - polite, friendly and helpful. She is sending new parts, which should arrive in a couple of days. The other times that parts have been sent, everything arrived in a timely fashion, so I hope and expect the same this time as well.\r\r\nI really like Kohler products and love their lifetime warranties!! Terrific customer service is a huge plus too. I will definitely be purchasing Kohler products when we build our new house in the year or so. I have no affiliation with this company but wanted to post a positive review because, having read hundreds of customer reviews of plumbing products, appliances, etc., in planning a new house, I am aware that people always want to vent rage and frustration if they have a terrible experience (me too! ); but most of us don't take the time to write a review if things go as expected!\r\r\nIt's hard to get an objective opinion of a product or company if only the frustrated people review it. How many happy people are out there but haven't publicly mentioned that their fridge/shower/toilet has worked just fine for years? Impossible to know. Anyway, thank you Kohler, for consistent results. I don't mind having minor repairs after almost a decade of HEAVY use, if they are this easy to deal with.",

After having my bathroom remodeled and using the shower for about 2 years the base cracked around the drain due to a defect. I reported it to Kohler in Jan 2016 and was told they had my purchase on file and I would get a call from their corporate insurance co (Gallagher) for resolution.\r\r\n4/2016: After two follow-up calls to Kohler, I received an email and a claim form from Judith (my claim rep) at Gallagher. They requested complete information regarding the unit including photos, installation information, and even requested I return the shower to Kohler ï¿½ really? Upon speaking with Judy, I was told that she would check with Kohler and they would send an adjuster out as soon as one was available. 5/20/16: As requested, I sent several photos, receipts and an estimate for the repair. I received an email saying Kohler will only send an adjuster out when the shower is removed/repaired and that I should contact my own insurance to file a homeowner's claim.\r\r\n10/2016: Received email from Gallagher that a new claims handler has been assigned (Robert) to my claim and after speaking with him I was asked to get an estimate and to send him photos of the damage. 11/2016: I resent the photos, damage, and the estimate to them to again review. 1/2017: Received email from Robert saying he should have an update in a few daysï¿½ 2/2017: No response - sent Robert a follow-up. 3/2017: Received email from Robert saying ï¿½they will still need to have me have someone come out to remove and inspect the baseï¿½.\r\r\n4/2017: Received email from Gallagher that a new claims handling adjuster has been assigned (Tracy) to my claim and asked if this claim was resolved. 5/2017: Sent response that it had not been resolved and Iï¿½ve been without an upstairs shower for over a year! Tracy responded to my email asking again for photos of the damage and suggesting that I again contact my homeowners for the claim. I sent a response that Iï¿½m having the shower removed so that Kohler can send an adjuster out to inspect it and settle my case. Tracy responded that it is not necessary for them to send an adjuster and photos will be fine. Argh!\r\r\n5/2017: Received an email from Gallagher that a new claims handling adjuster has been assigned (Jose) to my claim and please send photos to him for review. 6/2017: Sent Jose photos of shower base removal, drain defect and wall damage. Received a prompt response asking for (you guessed it) more photos! Will send ï¿½ one last time the same photos Iï¿½ve sent several times already. I thought Kohler stood by their products?",

        "desc": "I am a contractor with over 9 years experience. I just completed a total remodel on a house. I used Kohler's shower/tub combo faucet. I tested the system prior to tiling (as anyone with experience would do). I then tiled the entire tub area to the ceiling. I installed the Kohler items and when I tested it again water would come out of the shower head when using the tub filler. I then spent 3 hours disassembling and reassembling the tub filler without any success of remedying the issue. I finally called Kohler. I was instructed that it requires copper pipe fitting and will not work with pex piping. I ripped the drywall out of a finished closet and re-plumbed the shower head with copper. It still didn't fix the issue after 11 hours of labor.\r\r\nKohler decided that the valve was bad at that point, and mailed out a valve. I put the valve in, it reduced the problem, but it still existed. I finally just reduced the water pressure coming into the house at the main to fix the problem. This unit was so sensitive to water pressure that it would also blow out a gasket in the tub filler when the stopper was pulled in order to engage the shower head. This product in particular is very poorly designed and very cheaply made. The kitchen faucet is starting to make a high pitched noise when used. As a professional contractor, I will never use their products again. I communicated all of this with them and they chose to do nothing.",

They have a lifetime warranty on all their products for original owner, as do most companies such as Delta or American Standard. In the past these 3 companies have been great re their warranty. In the several year Kohler stands out as the weak link. When we had customer warranty issues recently, many parts have been back ordered for weeks or months. Their CS line often hangs up automatically saying due to excess call volume please call back later. When our staff gets through, their delivery timeline is never even remotely accurate, often by more than 30 days. So we buy the parts our self to keep our customers happy, then put their replacement part in inventory eventually when it arrives. It works, but is bad business on Kohler's part. Delta and American Standard always get their parts to us with 24-48 hours; Delta is the BEST for warranty.\r\r\nWe have no idea what has occurred at Kohler, but are using less of their products recently due to poor CS. We warn our clients that Kohler's CS has deteriorated, and encourage them to select other brands. Kohler products are good, but their follow up has deteriorated. Every mechanical part has a potential of failure, we know that, but reputable vendors should take care of it immediately. WE DO!",

Additionally, the plumbers could not complete the job. A request and order for the missing parts was submitted 3 1/2 weeks ago and the missing parts still have not been delivered, though promises 4 times of delivery... Which never happened. I personally called Kohler, since the store that I ordered the system got no satisfactory results, and I got a 20 minute runaround from the girl from customer service. Obviously she did not give me service.\r\r\nI am very angry, frustrated and disgusted with the lack of service and the poor incomplete shipment. I expect someone to call to give me some satisfaction on the delivery of the parts. Lastly, the plumbers cannot complete the bathroom and cannot return for another week because they have waited for the final install as the parts to come never ever arrived. I expect someone to follow up with this and get in touch with me. I am a very very very dissatisfied customer. I used to think that Kohler was the best out there, how wrong I was...",

I normally use under 2000 gallons. The problem was a flawed and defective fill valve. There had been no sound of running water and no movement in the bowl or the tank, unlike a traditional flapper type toilet and as everything happens inside a virtually closed valve, I had no way of knowing it was running. My water bill came to over $700.00!!! I am senior and living on a fixed income and this is devastating.\r\r\nLowe's replaced the toilets with American Standard after the plumber warned me Kohler have a lot of problems. Along with getting store compensation from Kohler, Lowe's put a lot of effort into negotiating with Kohler to compensate me for the excess water bill which was due entirely to their faulty product. I have documentation to back up the amount in excess beyond my regular water bill which averages $20 per month. Kohler refused. So Lowe's offered me $200 to help towards the cost something they did not have to do as they had fulfilled their obligations. Kudos to Lowe's for their support! Avoid Kohler products unless you want to face what I have. Horrible product, total lack of concern for their customers.",

No replacement parts, nope.

The Rialto Toilet for many years has been established as being defective in design, and the manufacture and selling to the public by Kohler was well known since the year of 2000. Kohler's remedy for their defective product that was designed, manufactured and sold to the public through their distribution of this defective product, was a fix it kit in the amount of $47.00. An average person, in replacing a toilet seat to a Kohler Rialto Toilet would be impossible as the design of this toilet is internal.\r\r\nThe bolts that attached to this toilet come from underneath and are internal, and to replace are almost impossible. Kohler remedy to this situation is just put a bandage on it, not admitting that the design of this toilet in the first place was defective, that the toilet seat in having to be replaced wasn't their fault, and selling their product to the public, they are not responsible for any personal injuries their customers may incur from their defective product. In this case, it wasn't a matter of just replacing a Kohler Toilet Seat, it became such personal injuries to my 89 year old Grandfather, in which the toilet seat of the Rialto Toilet became unstable, the bolts (which were metal) became rusted, and the toilet seat itself, broke from the toilet, causing the toilet seat to become unstable, and the toilet seat sliding to one side, as he lifted himself from the toilet, causing him severe and painful personal injury.\r\r\nAt 89 years of age, my Grandfather has been active in all his business ventures, but since this accident that was incurred by a Kohler product, he has received personal injuries that may affect him for the rest of his life. You might think that my Grandfather could weigh more than 150 pounds that might cause this incident to occur, which is not the scenario. He weighs approximately 135 pounds, but is not mirror of a man, and runs several of his corporations to this day. Kohler Companies, Corporations, subsidiaries, and International Companies have not taken into consideration of what their defective products have caused to the general public.",

About three years ago, the spider cracks started appearing on my sink basin. I called Kohler and started a case, but was not told at the time that there was a one year warranty, not a lifetime warranty, on porcelain....which is the whole reason I bought Kohler. I finally got back around to following up with the receipt (I purchased at Home Depot) and Kohler. THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM. I started searching the web to see if there were similar issues....OMG....WE NEED TO START A CLASS ACTION SUIT! Kohler quite obviously knows there is an issue with these sinks and they keep selling them! Who can afford to replace their sink every year? I want my money back and enough to cover the plumber for installation so I can buy a quality sink and have this garbage replaced! I will NEVER BUY KOHLER AGAIN!",

A key ingredient in good work is to use quality products. For years, I have specified Kohler plumbing products. I practice what I preach. I have 3 baths equipped with Kohler products. I also have 2 kitchen sinks with Kohler faucets. Last night, I received a call that the Kohler Forte faucet which I had installed 3 years ago was not delivering any hot water. All of my clients are special to me. I immediately grabbed my plumbing tool bag and drove 20 miles in rush hour traffic. Most homeowners exaggerate. This couple did not. No hot water was available at the faucet. All other plumbing fixtures in the house delivered hot water. Simple crossing of the hot and cold lines confirmed that the hot supply line of the faucet was not working. A quick call to Kohler and I realized that the young individual in the cubicle farm located where ever knew more about construction and Ohio construction law than I do after over 30 years of experience. The fault was my clients and enough said.\r\r\nI purchased the unit at Home Depot. 3 different Home Depot plumbing employees (all 3 were either plumbers or retired plumbers) agreed with me that the condition of the unit was not normal. Nor did they believe that my clients nor their plumbing had caused the problem. Kohler's experts in the cube farm knew better. After 30 years, I am saying goodbye to Kohler. This was the second call back problem I've had in the past 30 days. Both incidences were units bought and installed 3 years ago. I replaced the defective unit with a Moen at my expense. Moen's sales will increase because of my clients trust in me. Now I need to decide which toilet manufacturer to give my money to.",

Well, it didn't, and it was annoying to have to regularly snap the handle back after just about every flush. In early August it was left running for several hours and we had a huge flood causing serious damage to carpet and hardwood floors. Same plumber installed a new handle without a word. Blamed us and also told us our cesspool was backing up, which he claimed caused the flood. The cesspool was fine. Kohler claims no problem with sticking handle has ever been reported. Well I've had dozens of toilets in my lifetime and never had a similar problem. Almost $2000 out of pocket. Lousy plumber AND lousy product.",

He said the clog was in the toilet S-curve itself, the pipes below are fine. The next 3 clogs I understood what was happening; if this toilet cannot handle my waste, who are they designing it for? Kohler customer service was spectacularly unhelpful; I would have at least felt better if they admitted the problem, or paid for the plumber visit, or some combination. Their agent actually said that 4 clogs in 3 years is NOT TOO BAD. Does she have any idea of what happens to a household when the toilet is clogged? That is totally unacceptable!!! And if there were 2 people using the toilet I could expect 8 clogs in 3 years?? I will never buy another Kohler toilet again, and I recommend that you don't either.",

There were no cracks in the sink or any damage at all for that matter. I was always very careful with my beautiful porcelain sink. The popping continued for more than 24 hours, slowly eliminating all of the porcelain that covered the sink separator, as it was a double sink.\r\r\nWe called Kohler. Resistant and disbelieving at first that we somehow must have been lying to them, as they insisted they had NEVER had this happen before, they eventually sent us a certificate to have the sink replaced with the same model. We took our sink to Home Depot and the exchange was completed without event. However, my fear of the porcelain sink never went away and since this episode I have again replaced my sink with a nice safe stainless steel sink. We were lucky. Families with small children or elderly may not have been. The potential for this porcelain going right into someone's eye or stepping onto the very fine pieces with bare feet or using your kitchen dish towel where pieces would hide, could all have caused injury. I would not recommend a porcelain covered cast iron Kohler sink to anyone.",

You may wind up being extremely disappointed, as we were. Alison **, Claims Adjuster, Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc.",

        "desc": "I had a new powder room remodel one year ago. The supplier highly recommended Kohler even though I had an old toilet from the 80s that took two flushes for solid waste to be flushed. Kohler always seemed like a great name in the business and I thought, Great, they've improved their product to maintain that good name. However, suddenly the toilet began leaking. My remodeler came in and reset the toilet on a new wax ring thinking it had failed somehow. Thing is, the seal looked good and well seated. The next day I called him and said, \"It's leaking again.\" I had company coming and needed that extra toilet in the house. Just to be sure I called a plumber instead. He came in with a little different ring and checked the outlet to the toilet for cracks. It looked okay. So he replaced it and off we went. But no...I hadn't even used the toilet that day and it was once again leaking!! Becoming frustrated, I called him back and he went over the toilet with a fine-toothed comb so to speak.\r\r\nFinally he found the problem. Under the bowl, nowhere near the flange that attaches to the wax ring, there is a white \"plug\" that repaired some kind of breach in the porcelain. IT WAS THAT which was leaking. Now to Kohler I go for replacement. To tell the truth, I would rather go with another company's product. But since this was such a recent purchase I'm going to seek restitution. From prior reviews, I'm praying I can get assistance.",

My installer cut my granite to fit the model 5846 because Kohler did not have the sense to rename the sink Brookfield II or some other name. Because of that, I had to return the sink to Home Depot who insisted they did not have model K5846 and I ended up purchasing it from Ferguson Electric for $569.30. An extra expense that I did not need in my 70's and on Social Security. I believe Kohler should reimburse me $220 for their error.",

        "desc": "Kohler XT-7 Gas leak: I bought a Husky pressure washer about 3 years ago. It is only used maybe 3 times a year. Tonight (6-17-13) I noticed a VERY strong smell of gasoline in my garage. This garage is attached to the house so this was a major concern right away. After checking the cars and lawnmower and finding nothing amiss, a look at the Husky pressure washer solved the mystery. There was a very heavy leak coming from the Kohler engine and a puddle of gasoline under the machine. Eventually, the smell of gasoline was detectable throughout the entire house. It was quite a job to get rid of the smell and the puddle of gasoline.\r\r\nI have been around many types of gasoline engines my entire life and have NEVER seen anything like this. I mean, the machine was just sitting in its storage place and this leak occurred. Luckily, we were home and caught it very quickly. What if we weren't home and something were to occur and caused an explosion, etc? Apparently, this is not an isolated case with Kohler from what I see on the internet. If this is an acknowledged design flaw with these engines, shouldn't there be a recall or governmental legal action to prevent a potential disaster from occurring? I would hope that everyone who has been through this very upsetting experience would make their voice heard.",

We went on hold for a week, and came back to a wet, ruined floor. I was certain I installed the toilet correctly but thought maybe... so I repaired, replaced the floor, reinstalled the toilet with over size wax ring, placed a paper towel under edge of toilet, and two days later, wet paper towel! This time I took the toilet out immediately and looked underneath, sure enough, water was coming from the underside of the toilet, it was cracked in two places. Both spots looked like they had been checked and supposedly resealed with white sealer by Kohler, but obviously, the seal did not work. Both toilets are going back to the store where we bought them, I will not take a chance on trying the second unit and we will never buy another Kohler product. They make a sub-par product which is not inspected correctly and causes major damage in people's homes. I am extremely dissatisfied and angry that a company that claims to be high-end sells such a poorly made product. I will be contacting Kohler to claim for costs due to damages, but from reading their warranty, we do not think they will even care.",

        "desc": "So I recently quit working at a call center, Kohler is one of the call center's clients. Anyways, I quit because of the ridiculous \"service\" (If you want to call it that) about how Kohler has their account set up. Right on the front of the Kohler manual is the phone number and says \"for Tech Support please call\" and the phone number is right on the front. Here is the kicker; Kohler does not offer a tech support, or even basic information. All Kohler will do is referring you to a local dealer; besides a handful of them none of them know what they are talking about.\r\r\nThe way Kohler has their account set up, they do not provide any of their employees with product information. So for example, I would get a call from a customer saying \"Hello, I have a 50 Kw, it is not working; do you know why?\" Ready for this, I do not even know what a 50 Kw is. So I'm answering the call saying, \"Thank you for calling Kohler power systems. How may I help you?\" But yet, I have 0 support I can provide them. It was so uncomfortable... but it gets worse. Kohler sells your information, and before they will refer you to a dealer (who can't help you anyways), they ask for all of your information. This is exactly how a call would go:\r\r\nCustomer or a tech would call in with the problem or question; it would be something as silly as what color screws are on the generator, or what the decibel level is, or even what color the generator is. Some people want pricing, some looking for install manuals. Kohler offers none of that. So Kohler then advises to contact their local distributor or dealer. And, of course, no one knows who that is so Kohler will happily look it up for you, but they say they need a record of the call. So they then would ask for your first name, last name, mailing address, phone number, night time phone number, email address, where you found Kohler toll free number, and type of generator you have.\r\r\nThey will then provide you with a phone number, and can't transfer you. Now here is the kicker. If you hang up and call right back, they will ask you for all the information again. Now they said they need it for a record, but if you ask them to pull a previous record... they can't do that, lmao. But as a client of Kohler, they trained us, the employees, that their contact information is sold to 3rd parties. After 2 weeks I said ** that job and quit. It was so uncomfortable to put customers in that position I wanted no part of it.\r\r\nLast thing, I want to ask for anyone who may have to call Kohler for any reason. Please don't become angry with the agent. Trust me, they do not want to ask you all those questions. Kohler makes them do it, if they want to keep their job. In this economy, you are lucky to have one. Here is a secret. If you just say: I do not want to provide my information at the beginning of the call, the agent can look up your distributor with just your zip code. Also, reach out to Kohler headquarters and tell them that when you invest thousands into a generator, you would expect good customer service. I hope everyone enjoyed my rant.",

I first began in late February with my first order and got it home before I noticed the base was broken and returned it in early April. The second arrived early May at Lowe's broken and they caught it. I called Kohler to see if they could assist with expediting my order, but they could apparently care less about dissatisfied customers nor bad feedback. They simply place the toilet in a shaped cardboard box with little to no reinforcement, causing breakage if handled roughly.\r\r\nI can see how this affects their profitability or worse, indicate a poor design which breaks easily. The style is Devonshire. I hope American Standard is still in business when I start my next project as I seriously doubt I will do business with Kohler again if they give no consideration to helping customers.",

We have had very few problems with Kohler quality and performance in the past, but I must agree with \"the runaround\" the tech guys give the consumer. We recently installed a customer-supplied Kohler K-1418M in a Master Bath (this is an $8000 whirlpool tub) and have had a Kohler-certified repair tech out for the last 6 months attempting to quiet a very loud noise when the back jets are turned on - still unsuccessful.\r\r\nI have had the Kohler rep out (a very pleasant individual and another reason I would buy Kohler again), but this seems to be an engineering issue (but getting the tech guys at Kohler to admit to it is impossible). So, I would recommend that consumers stay clear of this model. As the general contractor, even though this is not my responsibility, I will be there through full resolve - no matter how long this takes (I stand behind everything we do). So, may I add?

My client sent me pictures of the white plastic jets and covers on three of the jets that have failed due to some mystifying shrinkage and cracking. Kohler has never sent out a representative to view the damage, nor offered to complete a product analysis as to the reason for the failure, even though they claim to warranty their product for a year.\r\r\nInstead, they have their technical people look at tour photos and state that the customer must have used a harsh chemical or soap or detergent in the tub. They refuse to replace these 6 simple pieces in order to maintain good will. It is mind boggling to me how a company can make such a determination with sending a representative to look with their own eyes. I paid $1,440 from the supplier for this entire tub with jets, motors and inline heater; they want to charge me $414 just for the plastic jet cover kit. They think that the client abused the jets because some pieces are missing.\r\r\nWhen you look at my attached photo, you will see that it is obvious that this thing shrunk and cracked. And yes, the owner removed the loose sharp pieces for safety reasons (he is a doctor). If you are interested in hearing about their run-around live and in person, my case number is ** and their no-help line is **. I suggest you take your tub business somewhere other than Kohler.

It did not sit even on the floor as several tabs on the underside protruded past rim that sits flush to floor. After several trips to the supplier, we found several more that had the same problem. Two had toilet bowls that were tilted to one side. One, I brought home, only to discover the same after it was installed (1/2\" of level). As others have complained, the interior glazing in the bowl of one has started to wear away. It requires more frequent cleaning. Several toilets did not flush properly and one was constantly plugging up. I was constantly repairing the fill valves on 3 toilets. They either started to fill more slowly (2 minutes plus), became very noisy or did not fill at all.The last one purchased was one of their class 5 units. We wanted a 6-liter per flush and had to order one at extra cost. It is clearly marked as a 6-liter or less on the toilet bowl and on the flush valve. Apparently, the only difference between the 6 and 4.8 liter models is the plastic flush mechanism. The problem is that the toilet allows less than 5 liters per flush and there is no adjustment to compensate. Extra money for nothing. The flush handle broke off on 2 toilets. Fortunately for me, I was able to resolve all issues myself without having to call a plumber. I resolved fill and flush issues by replacing all internal tank guts on 3 toilets with a \"Korky\" fill valve and a simple flapper. The tank fills in about 15 seconds. No fill or plugging problems in over a year. I would also suggest buying from a big box store as they are more receptive to resolving problems. By the way, no help from Kohler.",

They do not care about their customers. We are nothing but numbers. They sell their product and then spend all their time trying to get out of fixing them or making things right with the customer. This tub cost my mother close to $8,000, not to mention the labor and other things required to be done to have a tub like this installed. I have never been so disappointed in a company in my life.

I was then told by the supplier via e-mail that \"Kohler has these requirements to make sure they protect themselves from fraud and false claimsï¿½.Through sheer persistence on my part, the supplier finally agreed to come out at no charge. He came, took the pictures, and I heard nothing more until my next e-mail. The reply was \"they are saying the only thing that might work is their cast iron cleaner used in conjunction with a piece of cork\". Their cleaner, according to the label, is made for their kitchen sinks and it did not work. Through sheer persistence and the good fortune to have friends who have friends, I was put in touch with a Kohler tub repairer in my area who went to bat for me. The scratches were removed using a special compound and buffer at no charge to me although Kohler had the gall to tell the repairer that the scratches were not covered under their warranty. They should try reading their warranty.Had all else failed, I was prepared to take the supplier to small claims court. No one has yet come up with an explanation as to why the tub would scratch from a dropped plastic bottle.

I tried more than 4 times and they told me that is no gasket I was looking for, of 2.25\" ID and 3.75\" od. This gasket is not between tank and bowl I explained to them, but to the bottoms of the dual flush valve, inside the tank, which fasten outside by PVC nut so too tight against this. Finally after 3 weeks I got from a local plumbing store a similar gasket, not quite as original, but did not leak the water in the bowl. Now when I put the valve back and turn on the water is leaking all the time. This was from special order, Home Depot, Orange, CT. I think that I am still in title for a new dual valve, since no one can help me how to fix this annoying problem over 3 months. Please help.",

        "desc": "Kohler is not an ethical company. I've been reading about the many ways in which they have gypped customers or been completely unresponsive to major problems with their products. My experience isn't nearly as bad as a lot of peoples', but it does give an idea of the kind of company Kohler is.Several years ago, we bought a lovely, decorated sink from Kohler. It came with a plastic covered wire grill that fits in the bottom of the sink to protect the decorated porcelain. Over the years, this grid had sustained the inevitable nicks of usage and the underlying wire has started to rust so that the grid was no longer very attractive. My husband went to a local Kohler dealer and ordered a new grid.Imagine our surprise when this grid, which can certainly be manufactured for under $5, cost us $56 dollars! I wrote to the Kohler company asking for some sort of explanation. I received an answer saying that the grid was made to fit the sink (it is) and the asking price was... over a hundred dollars! I suppose it is priced this high in order to make the customer feel the he is getting a bargain as he only has to pay $56. But how dishonest!The grid is made of the same material as a dish rack costing under $10 at target --only it isn't nearly as complicated as a dish rack. It is just flat with little feet. There is absolutely no reason in the world that this grid should cost so much.Will I ever buy a Kohler product again? Not if I can help it.",

        "desc": "I had my house built and we moved in April, 2007. As part of the building process we had a generator installed by our local Kohler dealership (owned by Kevin Wright). They sized the generator based on the size of the electrical load of the house. In a nutshell, they undersized the unit. It works fine in the winter, but in the summer with the full load of all the air conditioners starting up can NOT be handled by the unit. As a result, it shuts it self off and provides no power to my house.Unfortunately for me, the Kohler dealer at the time is no longer a dealer for them. Kohler distribution/sales network is structured as: Kohler Corporate sells to a number of Distributors. The Dealerships buy from the Distributors and the Dealerships sell to the public. I've gone to the Distributor (RP Power) and to Kohler Corporate and have truly gotten no relief. I paid $17K for the 30KW generator and installation. My new Dealership has been very helpful in finding a buyer for my used unit. The resell price is $5K. My new generator (60KW) and installation will cost me $20K. Total, I'm paying $32K for a $20K generator.I'm eating the loss in equipment depreciation, plus paying for installation twice. Totally screwing the customer is what Kohler's idea of customer service is all about. I would not recommend Kohler to anyone.",

The screw on the right came out okay but the one on the left would turn and not unscrew. I called Kohler and they said I would need their anchor repair kit at $49. This is an outrageous price for two pieces of hardware worth about $2. I then decided to see what else I could do to get that anchor out. I noticed that the hole for the right side had filler around the bolthole and decided to clean it out. The hole eventually enlarged to 1/4\" to the ceramic. I pushed the excess material around the right side of the bolthole into the cavity with an awl then carefully pried the old anchor out. It worked and I had 2 each 1/4\" holes.I tried to find a wall anchor that would work but instead found some 3/8\" lead anchors, 1\" long, that uses 10-32 screws. Screws were 2\" in length. The anchors fit snug in the cleaned out holes. I then screwed a 10-32 nut onto the screw then screwed the screws into the anchor about 1\" and then turned the nut down to the top of the anchor. Then holding the screw in place with a screwdriver, I tightened the nut to tighten the anchor. I then loosened the nut, removed the screw from the anchor, and removed the nut from the screw. The last step was to mount the new seat. I installed it about a week ago and so far, so good. I also used washers where required, for spacing.",

About one month after installation, we noticed foam in the water but it cleared after running for 1-2 seconds. We assumed it was air bubbles. However, the problem progressed until the foam became more prominent and we eventually noticed a chemical odor and taste - much like a new garden hose smell - whenever we first turned on the faucet.This alarmed my husband and I because in addition to our health, we were concerned about our new baby consuming formula mixed with water from the kitchen faucet. We stopped using the faucet and contacted Kohler June 9 to complain and they were already well aware of the problem. I spoke to a service rep named Laura who asked very few questions, and promptly sent us a new faucet after assuring me it would not have this problem.When I inquired as to what caused the foam, Laura said that Kohler wasn't sure, they were still looking into it, but some of the faucets were doing it and some were not.It's now been just over a month since installing the new faucet and guess what? It's starting to foam again. I am so disgusted with Kohler and will never buy another one of their faucets again. I called Kohler again this morning and service representative Angela told me that \"Kohler is still working on the problem, so that's why the new faucet you received is still doing that.\" This is completely opposite what I was told in June when I shipped a new and supposedly improved faucet.I told Angela that I had no desire to receive a new faucet and that I wanted a refund so I could buy a different brand faucet that does not leach chemicals into our water. She was very pleasant, and requested. I fax a copy of my original sales receipt to a manager, Danielle, who will follow up with me within the week, and supposedly, will issue me a refund. I faxed my complaint and original cash register receipt to Kohler today. We shall see what happens.I believe Kohler should issue a recall.How many people are still using these faucets, unaware of the problem, not paying close attention, or simply unaware they should complain? We aren't the only ones with this problem. A quick search online reveals that both the Kohler Forte and Simplice faucets seem to have this foaming issue.",

The original seat bolts are screwed into corroded anchors that can't be completely unscrewed. I was able to partially unscrew the anchor and raise the screws enough to use bolt cutters to cut the screws. The corroded anchors can then be pounded down into toilet bowl land, where they remain inside the toilet. I purchased a new seat, but without the anchors, it can't be fastened.I'm not willing to pay Kohler $50 extortion money for new anchors for a toilet seat. So my main bathroom has a loose but usable toilet seat. I will never buy another Kohler product.

I called Kohler early Friday morning last week, and I was told that they had a kit for $47.10 that would remove the screw and the anchor bolt. Since my mother was coming home from a nursing home the next day, I wanted the seat replaced and ready for her use. I asked for overnight delivery and was told it would cost extra, which I was willing to pay. Amber said that FedEx would deliver.Saturday at noon, I called FedEx to track the delivery and was told it would not arrive until Monday. I sent an e-mail complaint to Kohler. On Monday, the kit arrived. I spent the whole evening trying to use the kit. It did not work. That Kohler did not have some of these instructions on their website is appalling. So Tuesday morning, I called Kohler. They do not have any simple way to talk to someone about your complaint. Laura told me that all the expensive toilets were designed this way and that they do not have a problem. I asked for another option, and she said that I could take a hacksaw to it. When I said that they did not meet my delivery date, they said to take it up with FedEx. When I said I needed to present a stronger complaint, she said I could complain to the designers.",

Upon calling customer service and waiting for 15 minutes we were informed that there was NO substititue available and Kohler would mail us the bumers (but we needed to have the shower usable sooner than the week it would taketo get the bumers) #3 the upright \"angled\" pieces did not match the contour of this shower - even though they were specifically made for it, so we had to sand them down with a belt sander for a fit that was a lot less than ideal.",

They were installed in the home as it was being built and I moved in a month ago. Upon moving in, I discovered that all 4 toilets had very weak flushing. I had a small party the week after moving in and the toilets clogged 4 times. I contacted the plumbers and the supplier and they all took a look and said it was not installed incorrectly and that it was just the Kohler design. I asked the supplier to take the toilets back and they informed me that only with authorization from Kohler could he give me a credit so I could buy different toilets. He told me to contact Kohler to get a letter authorizing the return. I called Kohler support and at first thought they were going to help. I was told a letter was being sent and that I could use it to return the toilets. Unfortunately, when I received the letter and it approved me to replace the 4 toilets with 4 exact models. It didn't authorize a credit as promised over the phone. I called Kohler and they told me that a replacement was the best they could do for me. At that point I decided to contact the supplier and they said their hands were tied. Pretty much I was stuck with the toilets or I could buy 4 different toilets on my own dime. I am now writing and calling various upper managers at Kohler to try to resolve this issue. I have told my supplier that they need to have some sort of return policy and they are not allowing me the return due to Kohler rules. From my research online, I am finding that not only the Kathryn Comfort Height elongated one-piece toilet - K-3324 are poor in flushing , but almost all consumer opinion points to the Kohler Ingenium flushing system as being mediocre at best. Most people are describing the same situation as me in that they need to flush multiple times and the toilets are clogging a lot. This model needs to investigated and Kohler needs to be held accountable for this horribly designed product. It seems to me that their policy is to sell as much as they can and never take anything back. I mean - who really woudl ever return a toilet anyways once it is installed. I am betting most people just try to live with the poor design or just use a different bathroom. The public needs to be aware of Kohler's horrible customer service and awful return policies. If Kohler were to offer me a full refund I might repeal my lifetime ban of their products. This will be a lesson I tell everyone and be sure that Kohler will be getting a lot of bad word of mouth after my experience. They may have gotten my purchase this time, but they will be losing a large number of purchases in the future due to their poor design and awful approach to customer satisfaction.",

        "desc": "I purchased 7 Kohler toilets, model # 4584 - San Raphael; each at a cost of $867.00. Over the years, we have had some floods resulting from leaking toilets; some small and some of Biblical proportions. The first flood took place while the house was under construction so the builder's insurance paid to replace all the wall board in 3 rooms, the hardwood floors in 3 rooms and the entire stairway. The delay in closing on the house was both costly and emotionally exhausting. The second toilet that leaked cause $660.00 in damages as a closet had to be rebuilt. This expense was borne by us. The third of the 7 toilets to leak caused $2,247.00 in damages; not enough to turn over to our insurance company as we have a $2,500 deductable. The fourth toilet that leaked was, fortunately, over a garage so we did not bother to do repairs but the cost of a carpenter opening the wall was $79. Since purchasing the toilets, we have had over $3,000 in plumbing bills for toilet repairs. Two weeks ago, the fifth of 7 toilets leaked and brought down the kitchen ceiling. It ruined appliances, floors, ceiling and furniture. This flood was costly enough to turn over to our insurance company.When I called Kohler to ask for assistance in getting a plummer to help repair the toilet, I was not to be heard. Eric, who I spoke to, would simply not listen and kept interrupting as I tired to explain the situation I was dealing with. Kohler finally agreed to repalce the toilets. Two days ago, 6 toilets were dumped in my driveway. Each box was marked with Heavy - 136 polund. My husband and I are seniors and had to try to move six enormous boxes into the garage to protect them from Hurricane Hanna's torrential rains. Yesterday, a plumber from Kohler installed 6 toilets, Model K-3466. When I awoke this AM, I heard water running. Inspection of the guest room revealed that the toilet had been running all night and the bathroom floor was covered in water. After lifting the tank lid, water sprayed all over the counter and floor. The toilet was turned off. I still don't know if the water was leaking into the living room ceiling. Only time will tell. We inspected the 5 other installations and found that none of the toilets worked. Two could not be flushed at all. The other 4 kept running after they were flushed and there was no waya to reflush them.After checking the internet for complaints about Kohler, I read that the K 3466 had been recalled and that Kohler replaces defective toilets with seconds or damaged toilest that can not otherwise be sold. I called Kohler and after a 45 minute wait, I spoke to several rude people, Eric included. He seemed to brush off my concern that I have 6 new Kohler toilets, all of which do not work. He constnatly interrupted with how lucky I was and how much he was doing for me. I needed to shout over him in order to be heard, but even that did not work. He admitted that if I had only one or two defective toilets, he would not have replaced them but because I had 7, he decided to replace them. Obviously the replacements were defective.Kohler does not care how much damage their products cause. It is most likely cheaper for them to replace (or not in some cases) the damaged product with an unsaleable product than to recall a product. Not only is the quality of the Kohler product extremely poor, the service department has much to learn about treatment of customers. I suppose they do not care how rude they are as once you learn how poor the quality of their product is, you will never be a repeat costomer anyway. This is a company that has much to learn about standing behind their product. As far as I know, Eric is still talking as he never seemed to have to draw a breath. Whatever I said fell on deaf ears so after many attempts to get a few words in, I hung up in frustration.About $9,000 in damages and plumbing bills over the last 10 years; all out of our pocket. About a $15,000 claim on our insurance for the last flood.",

Its a model K-3386, This model has the mounting bolts built in the toilet! Poor design! Have had trouble with the flapper valve when I go to change it,won't seal? Will purchase a new toilet, but it won't be a KOHLER, Broke the toilet trying to get the seat off!",
