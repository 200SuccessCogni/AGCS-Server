Everything was perfect except for one receptionist who was determined to treat my parents badly. Since I had been admitted to Apollo due to an emergency,and the room was already reserved in my name for a month, I asked my parents to rest there for the night since they just landed. The receptionist wouldn't let my parents into my own room. He kept them waiting for an hour and only after couple emails were exchanged between the company and hotel did he finally allow them. All of this at 2 in the morning. Not what I had anticipated from the hotel employees.Nevertheless, the hotel is fantastic.",

The check in process was very easy its all automated and there is a person to help us there if we get stuck. checkout was quick. On day 2 we had a issue with out key we couldnâ€™t get inside the room. We reached out to the lobby and they got the locksmith to work on the door and everything was done within 30minutes! Which is amazing !! Helpful and friendly staffs !! The gambling area is pretty small as compared to other hotels. Easy parking facility attached to the hotel.",
