Everything was perfect except for one receptionist who was determined to treat my parents badly. Since I had been admitted to Apollo due to an emergency,and the room was already reserved in my name for a month, I asked my parents to rest there for the night since they just landed. The receptionist wouldn't let my parents into my own room. He kept them waiting for an hour and only after couple emails were exchanged between the company and hotel did he finally allow them. All of this at 2 in the morning. Not what I had anticipated from the hotel employees.Nevertheless, the hotel is fantastic.",
